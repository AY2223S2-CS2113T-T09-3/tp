# Using this Guide

This guide will introduce you to the basics of using Meal Companion and its current set of features. Here we will briefly explain the types of icons and text you can expect to see, and how to interpret them. 

`Markdown text` like this indicates a command you can input, or a file name. For example, `this is a command you can enter` or `this_is_a_file.exe`. 

Within the `markdown text` you may see segments of text wrapped in `<chevrons>`. These chevrons indicate that this field in the command is a placeholder, to be replaced with your input. For example, a command `add <ingredient>` means you should enter the command `add apples`.

If not, you may download it [here](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/downloads/#java11). If you need further asssistance installing Java 11, you may refer to the [Installation Guide](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html).

2. Once you have ascertained that your device has Java 11 installed, you may download the `.jar file` [here](https://github.com/AY2223S2-CS2113T-T09-3/tp/releases/tag/v2.0).

Meal Companion uses a Command Line Interface (CLI), as the current version is just a proof of concept. We have plans to further develop Meal Companion to include a Graphical User Interface (GUI), or even to a mobile application platform. However as we have not yet reached that stage in our development, the CLI will suffice as the input method to operate Meal Companion. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

# Features
This section will focus on some of the key features of Meal Companion and explain their usage.

## Ingredients
Meal Companion will assist you in tracking the items in your refrigerator, and is capable of adding new ingredients, removing used ingredients, as well as listing the available ingredients in your refrigerator. This guide will detail these features below.

### Add Ingredients
To add an ingredient of a certain quantity to Meal Companion's storage, use the command `add <ingredient> /qty <quantity>`.
The `/qty` portion of the command is necessary for Meal Companion to distinguish between the sections of the command. 
For example, `add ground chicken /qty 300`.

![add1.png](images/add1.png)  
<sub>Fig 3: Sample of Add Ingredients command with user input highlighted.</sub>

### Remove Ingredients
To remove an ingredient of a certain quantity from Meal Companion's storage, use the command `remove <ingredient> /qty <quantity>`. The `/qty` portion of the command is necessary for Meal Companion to distinguish between the sections of the command.
For example, `remove ground chicken /qty 100`.

![remove1.png](images/remove1.png)  
<sub>Fig 4: Sample of Remove Ingredients command with user input highlighted.</sub>

### List Ingredients
In order to show a list of all ingredients currently stored in Meal Companion, use the command `ingredients list`.

![ingredientlist1.png](images/ingredientlist1.png)  
<sub>Fig 5: Sample of Ingredients List command with user input highlighted.</sub>

### Search Ingredients
If you would like to search for a specific ingredient that Meal Companion recognizes as valid, use the command `ingredients search <keyword>`.

![search11.png](images/search11.png)  
<sub>Fig 6: Sample of Ingredients Search command with user input highlighted.</sub>

Omitting the keyword will return a list of all valid ingredients.

## Allergens
Meal Companion recognizes that you may have certain dietary restrictions. As such, we have provided a feature that allows you to track your allergens and block Meal Companion from showing you recipes that contain said allergens. We will go into more detail on the Allergens function below.

Once your allergies are added to Meal Companion, you may refer to the section on [Possible Recipes](#possible-recipes) to see how this will affect the recipes available to you.

Due to certain design constraints, do note that your allergens are not saved within Meal Companion, so you will have to re-enter them each time you launch Meal Companion. We have plans to improve this feature in future iterations. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.

### Add Allergens
You may inform Meal Companion of any allergens you have by using the command `allergen add <ingredient>`. For example, if you have an allergy to eggs, you may use the command `allergen add egg`.

![allergenadd.png](images/allergenadd.png)  
<sub>Fig 9: Sample of Allergen Add command with user input highlighted.</sub>

### Remove Allergens
If you have erroneously entered an allergen, you may simply instruct Meal Companion to remove it from its list using the command `allergen remove <ingredient>`. For example, if you mistakenly entered an allergy to water, you may use the command `allergen remove water`.

![allergenremove.png](images/allergenremove.png)  
<sub>Fig 10: Sample of Allergen Remove command with user input highlighted.</sub>

### List Allergens
If you wish to see the entire list of ingredients you are allergic to, you may simply use the command `allergen list`.

![allergenlist.png](images/allergenlist.png)  
<sub>Fig 11: Sample of Allergen List command with user input highlighted.</sub>

If you wish to take a look at how the allergens you have added will affect the recipes available to you, please see the section on [Possible Recipes](#possible-recipes).

<sub>Fig 14: Sample of Recipe Possible command showing the list of ingredients and the recipes that can be made with those ingredients, with user input highlighted.</sub>

If you have entered an allergen that one of the recipes contains, you will not be shown this recipe. Please refer to the [Allergens](#allergens) section for more information. Below is an example of the allergen function in use.

### Random Recipe
Should you ever feel bored of cooking the same recipe over and over, Meal Companion provides you with the capability to choose a recipe at random. To make use of this feature, you may simply use the command `recipe random` to generate a random recipe.

![reciperandom.png](images/reciperandom.png)  
<sub>Fig 16: Sample of Recipe Random command being run twice to generate two different outputs, with user input highlighted.</sub>

### Check Ingredients for Recipe
If you wish to check if your current list of ingredients is sufficient to cook any recipe, you may use the command `recipe need <index_number>`. Ingredients that you are missing will be listed along with the quantity required.

### Almost Completed Recipe
If you would like to find out which recipes you are almost able to make with the ingredients you have on hand, you may run the command `recipe almost`. This will give you a list of recipes that are lacking at most 3 ingredients.

![recipealmost.png](images/recipealmost.png)

## Saving Data
Meal Companion automatically saves the ingredients you add to a text file named `ingredients.txt`. This text file can be accessed from the same folder where you downloaded the original `mealcompanion.jar` file. 

![save1.png](images/save1.png)  
<sub>Fig 19: Location of saved file containing all user-entered ingredients, within the same folder that</sub> `mealcompanion.jar` <sub>is stored.</sub>

### Transferring Saved Data to Other Devices
If you would like to access your saved ingredients list on a new instance of Meal Companion on a different device, it is as simple as copying and pasting the `ingredients.txt` text file to the new device. As long as it is saved in the same folder, Meal Companion will be able to detect it and utilize the existing data.
